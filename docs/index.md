### About

#### What is this guide for?

We write this step-by-step guide to enable all users to setup Seafile on their own, without the struggle 
of having to read the more complex and sometimes confusing [original manual](https://manual.seafile.com/).

#### How does it work?

This manual will guide you through each step of the setup. If you are new to Seafile we encourage
you to to the checks whereever we recommend them. This helps to pinpoint possible errors before you have to search for them.

This manual will show how to setup a Seafile Server using MariaDB, Memcached and Nginx as a reverse proxy.

All operations will be peformed as root unless otherwise specified. So login as root or 'su' to root, if logged in as ordinary user:
```bash
su
```

*To be extended...*  
*Explain how it works, "read+learn, setup, check, read+learn, install, check, etc."*
