### About

**What is this guide for?**

We write this manual to enable all users to setup Seafile on their own, without the struggle 
of having to read the more complex and sometimes confusing [original manual](https://manual.seafile.com/).

**How does it work?**

This manual will guide you through each step of the setup. If you are new to Seafile we encourage
you to to the checks whereever we recommend them. This helps to pinpoint possible errors before you have to search for them.

*To be extended...*  
*Explain how it works, "read+learn, setup, check, read+learn, install, check, etc."*
